OOP homework assignment 4 - Mathematical Expressions, Automatic Differentiation and Algebraic Simplification

In this assignment I delve instead into the magical world of mathematics. I will implement a system that can represent nested mathematical expressions that include variables, evaluate their values for specific variable assignments, differentiate them, and simplify the results.

In doing so we I work in a recursive framework, see some more examples of polymorphism, and practice the use of inheritance and class hierarchies for sharing of common code.
